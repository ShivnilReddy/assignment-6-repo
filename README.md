# Text Frequency Counter

This project is a simple text frequency counter that allows users to input text and determine the frequency of each word. It was created to practice DOM manipulation, JavaScript event handling, and basic web development concepts.

## Learning Journey

Creating this project helped solidify my understanding of JavaScript, particularly in using the DOM API to dynamically create and manage HTML elements based on user interaction.
